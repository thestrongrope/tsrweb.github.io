<p>A question posed
by some ignorant opponents of Shias is that if Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon
him and his progeny) had no surviving sons and he was survived only by his
daughter Hazrat Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her), then how can the descendants
of his daughter be known as “Aale Muhammad” viz. the progeny of Muhammad (peace
be upon him and his progeny)? The argument which they put forth is only an
Arabic couplet which states that “My sons, grandsons, and daughters are from
me, but my daughter's sons are not from me.”</p>

<p>If only those
who raise this doubt, instead of merely reading and focusing on memorising the
Holy Quran, had they reflected even slightly over its teachings, such
objections would never arise. Such questions and objections only prove that
those who claimed the Holy Quran to be sufficient for them have actually
distanced themselves from its true teachings. Also, they neither visit their
own books of traditions nor reflect over Islamic history before raising such
frivolous doubts. Here are replies to this objection – two from the Holy Quran
and three traditions from Ahle Tasannun sources:</p>

<ol><li>Allah the
Almighty states in Surah An’aam (6): Verses 84-85</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>"And We gave to him Isaac and
Jacob; each did We guide, and Noah did We guide before, and of his descendants
David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Aaron; and thus do We reward those who
do good. And Zakariyya and John and Jesus and Elias; everyone was of the
good."</em></strong></p>

<p>Prophet Isa
(peace be upon him) had no father. Yet, Allah included him in the progeny of
the Prophets through his mother Hazrat Maryam (peace be upon her). Similarly, Allah
has included the 12 infallible Imams (peace be upon them) in the progeny of the
Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) through Hazrat Fatima (peace
be upon him). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fakhruddin al-Raazi,
in his Tafseer al-Kabir, vol. 4, p. 124, says regarding this verse that the
verse proves that Imam Hasan and Husain (peace be upon both of them) are the
descendants of Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny). Since in this
verse Allah has verified Prophet Isa (peace be upon him) as a descendant of Prophet
Ibrahim (peace be upon him), whereas the former had no father, this
relationship is from the side of the mother. In the same manner, Imam Hasan and
Imam Husain (peace be upon both of them) are truly the descendants of the
Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, Ibn
Abil Hadeed Mo’tazeli, one the greatest scholars of Ahle Tasannun, in his Sharh
Nahj al-Balaaghah has cited the same verse, arguing that Hasan and Husain
(peace be upon them) are, from the side of their mother, the sons of the Holy
Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) in the same way that Allah the
Almighty in the Holy Quran has included Prophet Isa (peace be upon him) in the
progeny of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) from the side of his mother
Maryam (peace be upon her).</p>

<ul><li>Surah Aale
Imraan (3): verse 60 states: </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>"But
whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of
knowledge, then say: come, let us call our sons and your sons and our women and
your women and ourselves and your selves, then let us be earnest in prayer and
pray for the curse of Allah on the liars." </em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>None has ever
claimed that on the occasion of the Malediction (<em>Mubaahelah</em>) against the
Christians of Najraan that the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny)
took with him anyone except Ali Ibn Abi Talib, his daughter Fatima and her sons
Hasan, and Husain (peace be upon them all). Therefore, “selves” (اَنْفُسَنَا) means Ali Ibn Abi Talib, “women” (نِسَائَنَا) implies
Fatima and “sons” (اَبْنَائَنَا) refers
to Imam Hasan and Imam Husain (peace be upon them both) whom Allah the Almighty
has identified as the Holy Prophet's (peace be upon him and his progeny) own
sons. </p>

<ol><li>Muhammad Ibn
Yusuf Ganji Shafe’i, in his book Kifaayah al-Taalib and Ibn Hajar al-Makki in al-Sawaaiq
al-Muhriqah, pp. 74 &amp; 93 from al-Tabrani and Jabir Ibn Abdillah Ansari, and
Khateeb Khwaarazmi in Al-Manaaqib from Ibn Abbas, all relate that the Holy Prophet
(peace be upon him and his progeny) said: </li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“Allah created the progeny of every Prophet from his own generation,
but my progeny was created in the generation of Ali.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Khateeb Khwaarazmi
in Al-Manaaqib, Mir Syed Ali Hamadani Shafe’i in Mawaddah al-Qurba, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal
in Musnad and Sulaiman Hanafi Balkhi al-Qunduzi in Yanaabi’ al-Mawaddah relate,
in more or less the same words that the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his
progeny) said: </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“These, my
two sons, are two flowers of this world, and both of them are Imams (leaders),
whether they are Imams openly or silently sitting at home.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sulaiman Hanafi
Balkhi al-Qunduzi in Yanaabi’ al-Mawaddah devotes chapter 57 to this topic and
cites many traditions from Tabaraani, Hafiz Abd al-Aziz Ibn Abi Shaiba, Khateeb
al-Baghdadi Hakim, Baihaqi, Baghwi and Tabari, all relating the same in
slightly differing versions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Towards
the end of the same chapter, Abu Salih writes: Hafiz Abd al-Aziz Ibn Al-Akhzar,
Abu Nuaim, Tabari, Ibn Hajar al-Makki in al-Sawaaiq al-Muhriqah p. 112, from
Muhammad Ibn Yusuf Ganji Shafe’i in Kifaayat al-Taalib, and Tabari in the narrations
about the life of Imam Hasan (peace be upon him) relates that Umar Ibn Khattaab
said: </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I heard the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) say that <em>on
the Day of Judgement every ancestry will be disconnected except my generation.
Every generation of a daughter is from the father's side except the generation
of Fatima (peace be upon her), which is connected with me. I am their father
and ancestor.</em>”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hence, the Arabic
couplet quoted as an objection has no force in the face of all this contrary evidence
which clearly proves that Imam Hasan and Imam Husain (peace be upon them) are
the sons of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) and that the
descendants of Hazrat Fatima (peace be upon her) are the progeny of the Holy
Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny).</p>
