<p class="ar">الْحَسَنِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّؑ قَالَ اِنَّ اللهَ
افْتَرَضَ خَمْساً وَ لَمْ يَفْتَرِضْ اِلَّا حَسَناً جَمِيلًا الصَّلَاةَ وَ الزَّكَاةَ
وَ الْحَجَّ وَ الصِّيَامَ وَ وَلَايَتَنَا اَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ فَعَمِلَ النَّاسُ بِاَرْبَعٍ
وَ اسْتَخَفُّوا بِالْخَامِسَةِ وَ اللّهِ لَا يَسْتَكْمِلُوا الْاَرْبَعَةَ حَتَّى
يَسْتَكْمِلُوهَا بِالْخَامِسَةِ</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imam Ali Ibn al-Husain (peace be upon him) says,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Surely, Allah has made obligatory five things and He has not
made obligatory except good and beautiful things. Prayers, poor-rate, Hajj,
fasting and the mastership of us Ahle Bait (peace be upon them). The people acted on four but
took the fifth lightly. By Allah! The (first) four will not be completed till
they complete them by the fifth.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Note:</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allah is the All-Knowing Who knows what is good and what is
bad for His creatures. He is also the Wise and Just Who puts everything in its
place. If something is not fruitful for man, He will not make it obligatory. If
something is not harmful, He will not prohibit it. He is not unjust to anyone
even for an atom-weight. He is Needless and Self-sufficient. Therefore, when He
orders His servants to establish prayers, He knows that prayers are good and
beautiful for His servants. He is not in need of prayers that He ordered them
for His benefit. He does not intend to trouble His servants because He is not
unjust. Thus, everything that He makes obligatory is good and beautiful. When
the goodness and beauty of a thing is intense, Allah makes it obligatory. When
it is not so intense, He makes it recommended. For an obligatory act, there are
levels and the same applies for recommended actions as well. When an action is
neither good nor bad, neither beautiful nor ugly, He simply makes it
permissible for the servants. When an act is ugly and bad but not extreme in
its intensity, He makes it abominable and when it is extremely intense in its
ugliness and evil, He makes it prohibited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why Khums is not mentioned in the above tradition? The
reason is that Khums is an off-shoot of Zakaat. Just as he has not mentioned
Umrah because Umrah is a supplementary for Hajj. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fifth is the mastership of the Ahle Bait (peace be upon them). It is
necessary that people should accept their mastership; they cannot afford to
disobey or defy them or bear enmity against them. But the people did not pay
heed to it. Although, the four without the fifth are incomplete. In other
words, Allah will not accept these four without the fifth. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is prayer more important or mastership of Ahle Bait (peace be upon them)? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No doubt, mastership is more important because without it
prayers will not be accepted. The same applies for the other acts of worship.
Moreover, it is the Imam (peace be upon him) who guides the people to the more correct way
of performing all the acts of worship. But this by no means implies that a
follower of Ahle Bait (peace be upon them) should take his prayer lightly. For, the Ahle Bait
(peace be upon him) were an embodiment of divine worship and also exhorted their followers
towards prayers saying that their intercession will not reach to those who take
their prayers lightly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then why has Imam (peace be upon him) placed it after the four acts of worship?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Considering the understanding and comprehension levels of
the people is a very important thing. Otherwise, people will wage a war against
the Imam (peace be upon him). For example, there is a tradition in Bukhari, where the Holy
Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) addressed Ayesha as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"ar"} -->
<p class="ar">يَا عَائِشَةُ، لَوْلاَ قَوْمُكِ حَدِيثٌ عَهْدُهُمْ،
قَالَ ابْنُ الزُّبَيْرِ بِكُفْرٍ، لَنَقَضْتُ الْكَعْبَةَ فَجَعَلْتُ لَهَا بَابَيْنِ
باب يَدْخُلُ النَّاسُ، وَبَابٌ يَخْرُجُونَ ‏</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“O Aisha! Had not your
people been still close to the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (infidelity), I
would have dismantled the Ka’bah and would have made two doors in it; one for
entrance and the other for exit.” (Bukhari, Kitab al-Ilm, Hadis 126)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kabah had two doors since its inception. But the pagans
shut one door and kept only one door. The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) intended to
restore it to its original divine state but he (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) feared that the
people would not be able to digest this matter and it would lead to internal
strife in the society. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, in the above narration, Imam Sajjad (peace be upon him) has
kept the most important thing at the end of the duties. For, had he (peace be upon him) kept
mastership ahead of prayers, some stupid people would have risen against him
saying that he has disbelieved and would have gathered to kill him (peace be upon him). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was it right for Imam Sajjad (peace be upon him) to present Islam in its
distorted form (as in the above narration)? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answer is NO. Then why he has done it in this narration?
He has not presented it in its distorted form; actually, he (peace be upon him) has
presented it in its actual form. Although he (peace be upon him) has mentioned mastership in
the end, yet by mentioning that none of the acts will be accepted without
mastership, he (peace be upon him) has clearly underlined its importance. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hadis Saqlain is narrated by both the sects copiously. The
chains are of various kinds and the sentences too. Scholars have written
independent treatises on this tradition. We have presented here only one
narration from one chain and left the others for the sake of brevity.</p>
