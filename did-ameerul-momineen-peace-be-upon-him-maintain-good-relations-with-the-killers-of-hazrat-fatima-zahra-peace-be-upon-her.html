<p>Question</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Did Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) maintain good relations
with the killers of Hazrat Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her)?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reply</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The animosity of Ameerul Momineen
(peace be upon him) for those who oppressed Hazrat Fatima Zahra (peace be upon
her) is not a matter of doubt or debate. In fact, his hostility towards them,
because of the heinous nature of the atrocities committed by them, is a well-known
and documented fact. However, in order to conceal those crimes, the opponents of Shias often raise such baseless objections so that
the masses do not believe in what actually transpired.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a concise reply with some
proofs from the books of renowned Ahle Tasannun scholars who are considered to
be among their extremely revered and reliable personalities in the field of
Islamic history and traditions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Muslim Ibn Hajjaaj Neyshapoori writes: Umar, in
the presence of Usman Ibn Affaan, Abd al-Rahmaan Ibn Awf, Zubair Ibn Awaam and
Saad Ibn Abi Waqqaas, while addressing Abbas Ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Imam Ali
(peace be upon him) said: “When the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his
progeny) passed away, Abu Bakr came to power and both of you considered him to
be a liar, sinner, conspirer and a treacherous person. When Abu Bakr died and I
became his successor, you considered me also, just like him, a liar, sinner, conspirer
and treacherous.” <a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></li><li>Muhammad Ibn Ismail Bukhari writes on the
authority of Ayesha: “Ali (peace be upon him) introduced Umar as a tyrannical
and despotic person; he refused to meet Umar Ibn Khattaab and was extremely
uncomfortable with the presence of Umar in a gathering.” <a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></li><li>Umar Ibn Khattaab, on an expedition to Syria, told
Abdullah Ibn Abbas about Imam Ali (peace be upon him): “I have a complaint
against your cousin. I requested him to accompany me to Syria but he refused.
Your cousin seems to be forever uncomfortable with me. What could be the reason
according to you?” <a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></li><li>Both Bukhaari and Muslim have recorded: “Hazrat
Fatima (peace be upon her) was angry with Abu Bakr for this (usurpation of
Fadak). She expressed her dissatisfaction with him and severed all contacts
with him and did not speak to him till she left for her heavenly abode. When
she departed from this world, her husband Ali (peace be upon him) buried her at
night. He did not allow Abu Bakr (to be informed) about it and recited the
funeral prayers himself.” <a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are only few instances which are
mentioned in the books of Ahle Tasannun which clearly establish that Imam Ali
(peace be upon him) had severed his relations with the Shaikhain. Even after
these, if someone tries to prove that he was on good terms with them, then he
is either completely ignorant about history or has an ulterior motive to achieve
some worldly or political gains. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Few questions to those who claim that
Imam Ali (peace be upon him) was on good terms with the Shaikhain:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>If someone believes that they were liars, sinners,
conspirers and treacherous, then will he continue to be on good terms with
them?</li><li>Why did Imam Ali (peace be upon him) refrain from
meeting or even coming face-to-face with them and was discomforted even with
their presence?</li><li>Why did Imam Ali (peace be upon him) not
participate in battles along with them?</li><li>Why did Imam Ali (peace be upon him) bury Hazrat
Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her) at night and did not inform them about her
demise?</li><li>Why did Hazrat Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her)
express her displeasure and not speak to them till she left for her heavenly
abode?</li><li>Can calling them liars, sinners, conspirers and
treacherous be considered as their praise and glorification?</li><li>In one of his arguments, Ameerul Momineen (peace
be upon him) labelled their actions as extremely sinful and also said that they
deliberately opposed the orders of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his
progeny). <a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>
Does this qualify as their praise?</li><li>Whatever Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) has
expressed in his sermon of Shiqshiqiyyah, will that also be regarded as their
praise?</li></ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do the aforementioned narrations and
proofs leave any further scope for a person to believe that Ameerul Momineen
(peace be upon him) had cordial relations with those who oppressed Hazrat
Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her)? While these were only few examples from Ahle
Tasannun sources, there are a number of traditions and historical narrations in
Shia sources to prove that Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) did not have
even an iota of sympathy towards them, let alone things like paying allegiance
to them or praying behind them. Woe be unto prejudice!<br></p>
