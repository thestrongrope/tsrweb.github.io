<p class="ar">عَنْ اَبِي سَعِيدٍ الْخُدْرِيِّ قَالَ كَانَ
رَسُولُ اللهِ ﷺ ذَاتَ يَوْمٍ جَالِساً وَ عِنْدَهُ
نَفَرٌ مِنْ اَصْحَابِهِ فِيهِمْ عَلِيُّ بْنُ اَبِي طَالِبٍؑ اِذْ قَالَ مَنْ قَالَ
لَا اِلَهَ اِلَّا اللهُ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ فَقَالَ رَجُلَانِ مِنْ اَصْحَابِهِ فَنَحْنُ
نَقُولُ لَا اِلَهَ اِلَّا اللهُ فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللهِ ﷺ اِنَّمَا تُقْبَلُ شَهَادَةُ اَنْ لَا اِلَهَ اِلَّا اللهُ مِنْ هَذَا وَ مِنْ
شِيعَتِهِ الَّذِينَ اَخَذَ رَبُّنَا مِيثَاقَهُمْ فَقَالَ الرَّجُلَانِ فَنَحْنُ نَقُولُ
لَا اِلَهَ اِلَّا اللهِ فَوَضَعَ رَسُولُ اللهِ يَدَهُ عَلٰى رَاْسِ عَلِيٍّؑ ثُمَّ
قَالَ عَلَامَةُ ذٰلِكَ اَنْ لَا تُحِلَّا عَقْدَهُ وَ لَا تَجْلِسَا مَجْلِسَهُ وَ
لَا تُكَذِّبَا حَدِيثَهُ</p>

<p>Abu Saeed al-Khudri
narrates, “One day, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) was sitting and with him
were a few of his companions, among them was Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him). He
(peace be upon him and his holy progeny) said, ‘<em>Whoever says there is no god but Allah will enter
Paradise’. </em>Two of his companions (apparently referring to the first and the
second rulers) said, ‘We proclaim that there is no god but Allah’. At this, the
Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) remarked, ‘<em>The testimony of there is no god
but Allah will ONLY be accepted from him and his Shiites those whose covenant
Allah has taken (in Aalam-e-Zarr).’ </em>The two said, ‘But we believe that
there is no god but Allah’. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) placed his hand
on the head of Ali (peace be upon him) and said, ‘<em>The sign of this is that both of you
don’t untie his knot (of allegiance), don’t sit in his place (of caliphate) and
don’t deny his word.</em>”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Abu Saeed al-Khudri is
from the tribe of Khudrah, an Arabian tribe. He was a venerable companion and
Imam Husain (peace be upon him) has remembered him on the Day of Aashuraa. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Generally, in
traditions, when name is not taken in the negative connotation, it is due to
the fear for the life of the narrator because this person (the one who is not
named) is highly respected by some and hence, will lead to some problems for
the narrator. His followers will try to take revenge from the narrator. Hence,
here the two refers to the first and the second rulers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Untying the knot of
allegiance which was taken in Ghadeer and other occasions. Don’t usurp his
position of caliphate and don’t deny his sayings. But they did all that was
prohibited and even worse. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Question: This
tradition proves the Imamate of Ali (peace be upon him) but how does it prove the Imamate of
the other Imams (peace be upon them)?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Answer: Divine texts
amply testify that whatever is applicable for Ali (peace be upon him) is also relevant for
the remaining Imams (peace be upon them) from his progeny like obligatory obedience,
knowledge of the unseen, divine appointment, etc. &nbsp;اَوَّلُنَا مُحَمَّدٌ وَ اَوْسَطُنَا مُحَمَّدٌ وَ آخِرُنَا مُحَمَّدٌ وَ
كُلُّنَا مُحَمَّدٌ
(Behaar al-Anwaar, vol. 26, p. 16,
H. 2). All of them are one light. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apparently, every
criminal is a Muslim. Does it make him eligible for paradise? This tahleel
(saying there is no god but Allah) is not sufficient for a person to go to
Paradise. Umar killed a person for drinking wine. Obviously, that person was a
Muslim and eligible for Paradise. So why did Umar kill him while he was a man
for paradise? Thus, merely this statement for a person to go to Paradise. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imam Reza (peace be upon him)
during his journey to Neshaapoor recited the famous narration of the golden
chain (السلسلة الذهبية) in front of a huge gathering of Sunni scholars.&nbsp; He (peace be upon him) clarified that there are conditions
for it and that he (peace be upon him) is one of the conditions. That is, Imamate is one of
the conditions for a person to enter Paradise. No learned person – regardless
of his sect – will ever accept that a person like Saddam (may Allah curse him)
will go to Paradise just because he has uttered that there is no god but Allah.
Saddam himself will not accept such a logic otherwise he would not have killed
so many of his rivals like Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr or waged a war against Iran as
all of them were reciters of the kalemah. </p>
