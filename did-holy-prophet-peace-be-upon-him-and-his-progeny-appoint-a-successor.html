      <div class="card-body"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Ahle Tasannun go to any lengths in order to
justify that their Islam is correct and they are the real followers of the
Sunnah (practice) of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny). According
to them, not following the Sunnah is tantamount to disbelief and blasphemy. But
they do not realize that they are the frontrunners when it comes to deviating
from the Sunnah as far as succession to the Prophet (peace be upon him and his
progeny) is concerned, which without doubt is the most important and
contentious issue among Muslims. One of the arguments which they put forth in
order to defend the caliphate of the Shaikhain is their claim that when the
Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny) departed from this
world, he did not appoint anyone as his successor. &nbsp;They consider appointment of Caliph to be the
responsibility of the masses. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was it really so? Is there any truth in their claim?
Let us try and find out what was truly, the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (peace
be upon him and his progeny) with regards to appointment of a successor in his
absence. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>The Sunnah of appointing a successor

<p>The Messenger of Allah (peace be on
him and his progeny) was permitted to fight in the month of Safar of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
year of Hijrah. Let us have a look at who did he appoint as successors in
Madinah during his absence.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In all there were 27 battles and if we
count Khaybar and Waadi al-Quraa as two separate battles, they would totally
make 28 and the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) appointed successors
during his absence from Madinah. But there is something unique between the
appointment of all successors and Ali Ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon them both)
in Tabuk. Al-Masudi writes in Al-Tanbih wa al-Eshraaf and this was also
repeated by the Imam of the Hanbalis in his Musnad, quoting Sa‘d Ibn Abi Waqqaas:
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When the Messenger of Allah set off
for the Battle of Tabuk, he (peace be on him and his progeny) put Ali (may
Allah be pleased with him) as his caliph in Madinah. Ali said: ‘<em>O Messenger
of Allah! I do not like you going anywhere unless I be with you’</em>. The
Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) said to him: ‘<em>Will you
not be content to be in the same position with me as Aaron was to Moses except
that there will be no Prophet after me</em>?’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similar tradition has been mentioned
by Bukhari and Muslim quoting Sa’ad Ibn Abi Waqqaas that: “Allah’s Messenger
(peace be on him and his progeny) set out for Tabuk, appointing ‘Ali as his
successor. Ali said: ‘<em>Do you want to leave me with children and womenfolk</em>?’
The Prophet (peace be on him and his progeny) replied: ‘<em>Are</em> <em>you not
pleased that you are unto me like Aaron was to Moses except that there will be
no prophet after me?’</em>” <a href="#_ftn26">[26]</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, if this was the practice of the
Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) during his short absence
from the town and during his battles outside and inside the town, what do you
think he would do for his people after his final departure from this transient
world after which he would not return? Could he leave them neglected without
appointing any one for his nation to refer to? Ahle Tasannun believe so and if
one was to fall prey to their beliefs then it would mean refuting the Sunnah of
the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) resulting into blasphemy. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> Waddaan is a village near al-Juhfah, at a distance of 6 miles from
Abwaa’, which is approximately 23 miles from Madinah. The Messenger’s mother,
Aamenah, is buried there. Mu’jam al-Buldaan</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a> Bawaat
is a mountain of Juhaynah on the way to Syria. The distance between Bawaat and
Madinah is eight posts, and the distance between one post and the other is 12
miles. Mu’jam al-Buldaan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems that the Messenger of Allah
(peace be on him and his progeny), in the above two Battles, cared for the
tribal feelings of Ansar, by appointing his successors from them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a> While
chasing Kurz Ibn Jabir al-Fihri, who had raided the suburbs of Madinah, he
(peace be on him and his progeny) reached Safwan catching neither Kurz nor
al-Sarh. This Battle took place in the month of Rabi al-Awwal, after Bawaat.
Safwaan is a valley near Badr. Kurz Ibn Jabir Ibn Hasal al-Fihri was killed on
the day of conquering Makkah, when with the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him
and his progeny). Look up Jamharah Ansaab al-Arab, by Ibn Hazm, concerning the
lineage of Banu Muhaarib Ibn Fihri, and his biography in al-Isaabah</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref4">[4]</a> Dhu al-Ashirah is a place near Yanbu’, some nine "posts"
from Madinah, as in al-Tanbih. Abu Salamah is ‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Abd al-Asad. His
mother was Barrah, the Messenger’s aunt, the daughter of ‘Abd al-Muttalib. He
migrated to Habashah, then to Madinah. He attended the Barah war. He was
fatally wonded in the ‘Uhud war and died in the month of Jumaadaa al-Aakherah, after
three years of Hijrah. Look up his biography in ‘Usud al-Ghaabah</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref5">[5]</a> The Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) left
Madinah on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of Ramadan. The fight took place on Friday, the
19<sup>th</sup> of the same month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref6">[6]</a> The
biographers state that: When the Jews entered Madinah, they stayed in its
southern part, but found it to be unhealthy. So, they moved to its higher
places. Banu al-Nadhir dwelt in Bathan, while Banu Qurayzah dwelt in Mahzur,
both are valleys going down from Harrah. Banu Nadir spread in the orchards and
the fortresses. They stayed there until they were invaded by the Messenger of
Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) and were driven out of those places.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look up the entries: Bathan and
Mahzur, in Mu‘jam al-Buldaan. Abu Lubaabah is Bashir, or Rafa‘ah, Ibn ‘Abd
al-Mundhir. He was more famous by his agnomen. He was one of the leaders in
al-‘Aqabah Allegiance. Look up the biographies of Bashir, Rafa‘ah and Abu
Lubaabah in ’Usud al-Ghaabah.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref7">[7]</a> The Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) had to
chase Abu Sufyan, who had come, with 200 horsemen, to fulfill his oath to the
effect that he would not use perfumes nor touch women before taking his revenge
for his people who had been killed in the Battle of Badr. They reached al-‘Urayd,
a valley near Madinah. where they heard about the Messenger of Allah’s (peace
be on him and his progeny) intention to meet them. In order to rid themselves
of heavy loads, they started throwing away the bags of the al-Saweeq [wheat or
barky flour]. Hence that battle was called al-Saweeq Battle. [Mu‘jam al-Buldaan]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref8">[8]</a> Qarqarah al-Kudr is the region of Banu Salim, next to the
"Iraqi" district towards Makkah, at a distance of eight days from
Madinah. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny) left on the
15th of Muharram, for Sulaim and Ghatafan – the two tribes of Qays ‘Ilaan – who
were taken by surprise. He returned with the spoils without facing any
resistance. [Mu‘jam al-Buldaan]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref9">[9]</a> Faraan, Banu Salim’s region, in al-Far‘site of al-Hijaz. [Mu‘jam
al-Buldaan and Lisaan al-‘Arab, in the root of Faraan]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref10">[10]</a> The Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) fought
the enemy at the foot of the Uhud mountain, a mile from Madinah. He was absent
only for a single day and yet he appointed a caliph.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref11">[11]</a> Hamra’ al-Asad Battle was ten miles away from Madinah. He (peace
be on him and his progeny) set out for Abu Sufyan who was intending to attack
the town but could neither get him nor his companions. He (peace be on him and
his progeny) stayed there for three days and returned to Madinah.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref12">[12]</a> This was a battle in Najd, when the Messenger of Allah (peace be
on him and his progeny) set out for Ghatafan [tribes]. They fled away, and he
faced no difficulty. He was away from the town for ten days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref13">[13]</a> The
Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) besieged them for 15 days and
then they were deported out of it. The buildings of Banu Nadhir, the
Jews, were in Be’r Ghars in Quba and its localities. Quba is a village two
miles from Madinah. The name comes from the name of a well there. Mu‘jam
al-Buldaan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref14">[14]</a> He
stayed there for eight days because Abu Sufyan had warned that he would fight
them the next year in Badr. Abu Sufyan left Makkah to ‘Asafaan and returned to
Makkah once again. He was the leader of Banu al-Haarith in Bay‘ah al-‘Aqabah.
He participated in battles of the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his
progeny), and was martyred with two other leaders in Mu’tah. His biography is
in al-Isti‘aab and ‘Usud al-Ghaabah.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref15">[15]</a> Dhaat al-Riqaa’ is a mountain near al-Nakhil, next to al-Sa‘d and
al-Shaqrah, which is colourful, with red, black and white spots. The Messenger
of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) went after ’Ukaydir Ibn ‘Abd
al-Malik, the Christian, who used to attack the travellers and traders of
Madinah. He fled and his people were dispersed, so, he found nobody there. He
(peace be on him and his progeny) stayed for few days, then returned to
Madinah. It was his first raids against the Romans. Look up al-Mas‘udi’s
al-Tanbih wa al-Eshraf on this Battle. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref16">[16]</a> Doomah
al-Jandal was a fortress built in al-Jandal in a space of land. It is at seven
stages from Damascus, and at fifteen nights from Madinah. Look up Mu‘jam
al-Buldaan and al-Mas’udi’s al-Tanbih wa al-Eshraf concerning the events of the
fifth year of the Hijrah</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref17">[17]</a> A battle near the waters of al-Muraysi’ (Maa’ al-Muraysi’), a
place on the way to al-Far’, which is seven “posts” away from Madinah.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref18">[18]</a> Abu Rahm is Kulthum Ibn al-Husayn. He accepted Islam after the
Messenger of Allah’s (peace be on him and his progeny) migration to Madinah. In
the battle of ‘Uhud, he received an arrow in his neck but was cured when the
Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) applied saliva on his
wound. His biography is in ‘Usud al-Ghaabah.</p>

Lihyaan of Hadhil near ‘Asafaan whose lineage can be looked up in Ibn Hazm’s
Jamharatu Ansaab al-Arab, Egypt Ed., 1382 A.H. pp. 196-198. ‘Asafaan is
situated between Makkah and Madinah. Its exact location is contentious. [Mu‘jam
al-Buldaan]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="#_ftnref20">[20]</a> Dhu Qarad
is on the way to Khaybar. ‘Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari had raided Lufaahah,
while he was in al-Ghaabah, on a single “post”, or a little more, from Madinah.
He set out on Wednesday, the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> of Rabi’
al-Awwal. He saved a part of it and returned to Madinah. Look up: al-Tanbih wal
Eshraaf.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref21">[21]</a> The Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny) set off
for Umrah on Monday, the 1<sup>st</sup> of Zhul Qa’dah. But the polytheists
prevented him from entering Makkah. So he (peace be on him and his progeny)
stayed in al-Hudaybiyyiah, some nine miles from Makkah. Later, there was a
peace treaty between the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him and his progeny)
and Quraysh in which the elementary stipulation was that he should come the
next year for the minor pilgrimage (Umrah).</p>

After conquering its fortresses by force and peacefully, he (peace be on him and
his progeny) set forth to Waadi al-Quraa. He (peace be on him and his progeny)
besieged them for days and conquered it by force. Then he (peace be on him and
