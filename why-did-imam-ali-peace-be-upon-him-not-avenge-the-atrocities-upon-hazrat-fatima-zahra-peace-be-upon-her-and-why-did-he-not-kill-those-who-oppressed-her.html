<p>Prejudice has always overpowered the reasoning abilities of Muslims
while trying to absolve their leaders of their wrong-doings such as the oppression
upon Hazrat Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her), the beloved daughter of the Holy Prophet
(peace be upon him and his progeny). In order to defend their leaders, they go
to any lengths and even attempt to either distort history or raise such
objections and doubts for the fickle minded masses that the wrong-doings of
their leaders seem non-existent to them. Now-a-days, many so-called Shias have
also begun raising such doubts for political and financial gains. Unfortunately,
ordinary Shias fall prey to such objections and begin to doubt the actions of
our Imams (peace be upon them), especially those of Ameerul Momineen Ali Ibn
Abi Talib (peace be upon both of them). It should be borne in mind that neither
the objections nor their replies are new for us. But it is important for us to
remember the replies nevertheless. Let us look at one of the objections raised
and their brief replies. </p>

<ol><li>The right
of seeking revenge is among those which Allah, the High, has entrusted upon
blood relatives. But utilising this right is not mandatory. The blood relative
can either forgive or even demand blood money for it. There are many instances
where a person might have been killed by someone but his blood relatives do not
avenge the killing on personal, social or some other grounds and they prefer to
be patient over taking revenge. Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) possessed
extremely lofty morals and was personally trained by Holy Prophet (peace be
upon him and his progeny). He was the most knowledgeable of the sensitive
conditions of Muslims at that time and was also extremely aware of his
concealed internal and external enemies. Hence, acting upon the covenant and
the promise which he made to Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny), he
chose not to rebel against the usurpers for the salvation of the Muslim society.
He indicated towards this in the Sermon of Shiqshiqiyyah as well. The path he
chose for the safety of Islam was the best proof of his rightfulness. </li><li>Solitary
confinement, lack of supporters and assistance was another reason for his silence
which he expressed in the same sermon of Shiqshiqiyyah. </li><li>Those who
raise this objection and thereby try to deny the attack on the house of Hazrat Fatima
Zahra (peace be upon her) should be asked: <ol><li>Why did
Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) not take revenge from the
killers of Hazrat Hamza, uncle of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his
progeny)? </li></ol><ol><li>Why did
the companions not take revenge from those who attempted to kill the Holy
Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) after the expedition of Tabuk? </li></ol><ol><li>Why did the
Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) grant respite to and not take
revenge from Abu Sufyan, Muawiyah, Amr Aas and all other chiefs of the
polytheists and disbelievers who were hostile towards the Messenger of Allah
(peace be upon him and his progeny) and Muslims, waged wars like Badr, Ohad,
Khandaq, Khyber, etc. and martyred many Muslims?</li></ol><ol><li>Why was no
revenge taken from Usmaan Bin Afaan who, as per the narrations of the Ahle Tasannun,
killed Umm Kulsum, one of the daughters of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him
and his progeny)?</li></ol><ol><li>Does not
seeking revenge mean these incidents didn’t take place at all?</li></ol></li><li>Even if
Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) wanted to take revenge then which court of
law could he appeal to? History is witness that all the power was under the
control and supervision of the rulers and they used to conveniently alter the
cases as per their benefit. There are many such incidents. For example,<ol><li>Mughirah
Ibn Sho’bah committed adultery and there were witnesses against him but the
witnesses were not accepted and instead they were flogged on the orders of the caliph.</li></ol><ol><li>Khalid Bin
Waleed killed Maalik Ibn Nowairah and raped his wife but the caliph defended
the actions of Khalid and on the contrary justified his actions.</li></ol></li></ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These were only couple of examples where judgements were twisted in
the favour of the ones whom the rulers wanted to. This was also one of the
reasons why Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) did not revolt against or seek
revenge from those who oppressed Hazrat Fatima Zahra (peace be upon her). He
very well knew that even if he took steps towards seeking revenge, he will not reach
his aim because the judge who will supervise the case was the main culprit of
the case. </p>
